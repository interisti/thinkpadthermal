> When you create an extension, the extension is saved at ~/.local/shared/gnome-shell/extensions with a gnome-shell extension folder format, so you can't create a project here and edit the files expecting that each change you do reflects directly in the gnome-shell. So, if we use eclipse to develop extensions, the best way is to open directly the file you are editing, like ~/.local/shared/gnome-shell/extensions/myExtensionFolder/myExtension.js

> To visualize the changes, you need to have enabled the extension. To enable the extension use gnome-tweak-tool.

> After that, every time you make a change, you will have to save the file and restart the shell (**Alt+F2** , write **"r"** without quotes, **enter**).
